## User Authentication System

This is a simple user authentication system written in Python.

## Overview

The user authentication system allows users to register and log in. It provides basic input validation and stores user information locally.

## Code Description

The code consists of three main components: `logger.py`, `user.py`, and `main.py`. 

- `logger.py`: Provides logging functionality to record events during registration and login processes.
- `Auth_app.py`: Defines the User class with methods to register and login users.


## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   
   
Make sure to update the `<path/to/logfile.txt>`, `<server_name>`, `<database_name>`, `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<table_name>` placeholders with the actual values specific to your project. Additionally, include any necessary details about the usage and configuration of the project.

Create a file named cred.txt in the project directory to store the credentials. Add the following information, each on a separate line:
path/to/logfile.txt
server_name
database_name
username
password
table_name

Logging is the process of recording events, messages, or information during the execution of a program or system. It involves capturing relevant data and storing it in a log file for later analysis, debugging, or monitoring purposes. Logging is a critical practice in software development and system administration as it helps track the behavior of an application, diagnose issues, and understand the flow of execution.

Logging frameworks and libraries provide convenient tools and APIs to generate and manage logs effectively. They often allow different log levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error, critical) to categorize the severity of messages and provide flexible configuration options for log storage, formatting, and output destinations (e.g., files, console, databases, remote servers).
